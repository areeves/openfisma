OpenFISMA Database Migrations
============================================================================

This folder contains the up and down scripts to control schema changes to 
the database utilized by OpenFISMA. This provides a controllable configuration
management process which can be used to upgrade previous installations
without destroying data. This directory also contains a base.sql file, this
is the full copy of the OpenFISMA database schema and is always up to date
with all up and down scripts. 

Similar to Rails Migrations, the OpenFISMA Database Migrations packages 
standards and tools together to bring order to the usually chaotic process 
of version controlling the data model. Each change to the data model is called
a migration, and each migration consists of a pair of short SQL scripts 
(or patches) called up and down. The up script evolves the schema model 
forward one step, while the down script precisely reverses the effect of the 
up script.

By comparing the existing schema version number with the desired target 
version, a series of scripts can be executed to bring an existing schema 
(and all the data contained therein) to match any other intermediate or 
final schema version.
