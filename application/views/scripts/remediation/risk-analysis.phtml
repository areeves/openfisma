        A threat is the potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular 
        vulnerability. A vulnerability is a bug, flaw, weakness, or exposure of an application, system, 
        device, or service that could lead to a failure of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. 
        The threat level allows the organization to prioritize security weaknesses based on their level 
        of threat to the information system. Usually, the security level and description are pre-populated 
        from vulnerability scan data, however, manual findings need an assigned threat level and 
        description.

        The goal of this step is to analyze the controls that are currently implemented by the 
        organization to minimize or eliminate the likelihood (or probability) of the vulnerability 
        being exercised or exploited. This should not include countermeasures that are planned 
        and are not currently in place. Countermeasures or Security controls can be technical and
        nontechnical methods. Examples of technical controls would be; access control mechanisms, 
        identification and authentication mechanisms, encryption methods, intrusion detection 
        software, etc. Examples of nontechnical controls would be management and operational 
        controls, such as; security policies, operational procedures, personnel, physical, and 
        environmental security.
