            <p>The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to conduct an

            <p><u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance</u>: An independent certification agent or certification team is 
            any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information 
            system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
            with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of command associated with the 
            information system or to the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security 
            certification services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to 
            a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted certification services are 
            considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process 
            or cannot unduly influence the independence of the certification agent or certification team conducting the 
            assessment of the security controls in the information system. The authorizing official decides on the 
            required level of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity of the information system 
            and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and organizational assets, and to individuals. The 
            authorizing official determines if the level of certifier independence is sufficient to provide confidence 
            that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In 
            special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the 
            organizational structure requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished by 
            individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner or 
            authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be achieved by ensuring the assessment 
            results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, 
            consistency, and veracity of the results. The authorizing official should consult with the Office of the 
            Inspector General, the senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer to 
            fully discuss the implications of any decisions on certifier independence in the types of special

            <p>The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to conduct an 
            assessment of the security controls in the information system.</p>
            <p><u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance</u>: An independent certification agent or certification team is 
            any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information 
            system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
            with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of command associated with the 
            information system or to the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security 
            certification services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to 
            a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted certification services are 
            considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process 
            or cannot unduly influence the independence of the certification agent or certification team conducting the 
            assessment of the security controls in the information system. The authorizing official decides on the 
            required level of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity of the information system 
            and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and organizational assets, and to individuals. The 
            authorizing official determines if the level of certifier independence is sufficient to provide confidence 
            that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In 
            special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the 
            organizational structure requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished by 
            individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner or 
            authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be achieved by ensuring the assessment 
            results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, 
            consistency, and veracity of the results. The authorizing official should consult with the Office of the 
            Inspector General, the senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer to 
            fully discuss the implications of any decisions on certifier independence in the types of special 
            circumstances described above.</p>

            rule set for each policy specifies:
            <ol>
            <li>Access control information (i.e., attributes) employed by the policy rule set (e.g., position, 
            nationality, age, project, time of day); and</li>
            <li>Required relationships among the access control information to permit access.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p><u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Nondiscretionary access control policies that may be 
            implemented by organizations include, for example, Attribute-Based Access Control, Mandatory Access 
            Control, and Originator Controlled Access Control. Nondiscretionary access control policies may be employed 
            by organizations in addition to the employment of discretionary access control policies.</p>
            <p><em>For Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</em> Policy establishes coverage over all subjects and objects 
            under its control to ensure that each user receives only that information to which the user is authorized 
            access based on classification of the information, and on user clearance and formal access authorization. 
            The information system assigns appropriate security attributes (e.g., labels/security domains/types) to 
            subjects and objects, and uses these attributes as the basis for MAC decisions. The Bell-LaPadula security 
            model defines allowed access with regard to an organization-defined set of strictly hierarchical security 
            levels as follows: A subject can read an object only if the security level of the subject dominates the 
            security level of the object and a subject can write to an object only if two conditions are met: the 
            security level of the object dominates the security level of the subject, and the security level of the 
            user's clearance dominates the security level of the object (no read up, no write down).</p>
            <p><em>For Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</em> Policy establishes coverage over all users and resources

            <p><u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance</u>: An independent assessor or assessment team is any individual 
            or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information system. 
            Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with 
            respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management chain associated with the information system 
            or to the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security assessment services can be 
            obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector 
            entity outside of the organization. Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the 
            information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the 
            impartiality of the assessor or assessment team conducting the assessment of the security controls in the 
            information system. The authorizing official determines the required level of assessor independence based 
            on the security categorization of the information system and/or the ultimate risk to organizational 
            operations and assets, and to individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of assessor 
            independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be 
            used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when the organization that 
            owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the assessment be 
            accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the 
            system owner, independence in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment 
            results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, 
            accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.</p>

            <p><u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance</u>: Portable, removable storage devices (e.g., thumb drives, flash

            assurance that the device is free of all malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day 
            attacks. Organizations consider sanitization of portable, removable storage devices, for example, when such 
            devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when the organization

            <p><u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> This control enhancement is implemented within the remote 
            device (e.g., notebook/laptop computer) via configuration settings that are not configurable by the 
            user of that device. An example of a non-remote communications path from a remote device is a virtual 
            private network. When a non-remote connection is established using a virtual private network, the 
            configuration settings prevent split-tunneling. Split tunneling might otherwise be used by remote 
            users to communicate with the information system as an extension of that system and to communicate with
