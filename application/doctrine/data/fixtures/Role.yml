        name: Information System Security Officer
        nickname: ISSO
        description: <p><strong>[NIST 800-37 Definition]</strong></p><p>The information system security officer is the individual responsible to the authorizing official, information system owner, or the senior agency information security officer for ensuring the appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or program. The information system security officer also serves as the principal advisor to the authorizing official, information system owner, or senior agency information security officer on all matters (technical and otherwise) involving the security of the information system. The information system security officer typically has the detailed knowledge and expertise required to manage the security aspects of the information system and, in many agencies, is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day security operations of the system. This responsibility may also include, but is not limited to, physical security, personnel security, incident handling, and security training and awareness. The information system security officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the system security policy and to ensure compliance with that policy on a routine basis. In close coordination with the information system owner, the information system security officer often plays an active role in developing and updating the system security plan as well as in managing and controlling changes to the system and assessing the security impact of those changes.</p><p><strong>[OpenFISMA definition]</strong></p><p>The Information Systems Security Officer Group is designed to allow Information System Security Officers the ability to identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor the progress of corrective efforts for security weaknesses found in their system.</p>

        description: <p><strong>[NIST 800-37 Definition]</strong></p><p>The information system owner is an agency official responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system. The information system owner is responsible for the development and maintenance of the system security plan and ensures the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-upon security requirements. The information system owner is also responsible for deciding who has access to the information system (and with what types of privileges or access rights) and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior). The information system owner informs key agency officials of the need to conduct a security certification and accreditation of the information system, ensures that appropriate resources are available for the effort, and provides the necessary system-related documentation to the certification agent. The information system owner receives the security assessment results from the certification agent. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities, the information system owner assembles the security accreditation package and submits the package to the authorizing official or the authorizing officials designated representative for adjudication. </p><p>The role of information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the particular agency and the system development life cycle phase of the information system. Some agencies may refer to information system owners as program managers or business/asset/mission owners. In some situations, the notification of the need to conduct a security certification and accreditation may come from the senior agency information security officer or authorizing official as they endeavor to ensure compliance with federal or agency policy. The responsibility for ensuring appropriate resources are allocated to the security certification and accreditation effort depends on whether the agency uses a centralized or decentralized funding mechanism. Depending on how the agency has organized and structured its security certification and accreditation activities, the authorizing official may choose to designate an individual other than the information system owner to compile and assemble the information for the accreditation package. In this situation, the designated individual must coordinate the compilation and assembly activities with the information system owner.</p>
