            <p>A general support system is a set of interconnected information resources under the same
            direct management control that shares common functionality.  A general support
            system normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications,
            communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of
            users and/or applications. A general support system, for example, can be a:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>LAN including smart terminals that supports a branch office</li>
            <li>Backbone (e.g., agency-wide)</li>
            <li>Communications network</li>
            <li>Departmental data processing center including its operating system and utilities</li>
            <li>Tactical radio network</li>
            <li>Shared information processing service organization</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Major applications are systems that perform clearly defined functions for which
            there are readily identifiable security considerations and needs (e.g., an
            electronic funds transfer system).  A major application might comprise many
            individual programs and hardware, software, and telecommunications components.
            These components can be a single software application or a combination of
            hardware/software focused on supporting a specific mission-related function.  A
            major application may also consist of multiple individual applications if all
            are related to a single mission function (e.g., payroll or personnel).</p>
