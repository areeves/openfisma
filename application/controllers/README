In Zend Framework's MVC implementation, both the default 
action controller and the default action are named 'index'. 

By default, the front controller loads the ErrorHandler 
plugin, as well as the ViewRenderer action helper plugin. 
These are to simplify error handling and view 
renderering in your controllers, respectively.
