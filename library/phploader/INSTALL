Basic YUI PHP Loader Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Verify that the environment you intend to install YUI PHP Loader on
    has a working webserver, (e.g.) Apache, with support for PHP.

2. Extract the YUI PHP Loader archive to a location within the
    server's webroot (e.g.) htdocs/phploader.
    
3. Refer to usage documents and examples:

Local Combo Handler Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature will allow YUI PHP Loader to combine files without relying 
on a remote combo-service.  The key use case here would be someone 
writing their own website/application in PHP.

1. The main endpoint for combo requests in this case is combo.php.  Place
    this file in the same location as loader.php.
    
    Note: If the phploader directory does not live in the webserver's root 
    folder then modify the $pathToYUILoader variable in combo.php accordingly
    
2. Download and extract each version of YUI you intend to support into
    the phploader/lib directory.

    A valid setup would look something like:
    htdocs/phploader/lib/2.7.0/build
    htdocs/phploader/lib/2.6.0/build
    etc...
