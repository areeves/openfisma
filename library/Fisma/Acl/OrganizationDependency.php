/**
 * This interface indicates that an object has an access control dependency on an organization object
 * 
 * In other words, an object which implements this interface should not be modified unless the user performing the 
 * modification has the privilege to modify objects associated with this object's associated organization.
 * 
 * Example: The Asset class implements Fisma_Acl_OrganizationDependency by providing a getOrganizationDependencyId() 
 * method. When a user modifies an instance of Asset, such as $asset, the ACL layer verifies that the user has the
 * "edit asset" privilege for $asset's owning organization.
