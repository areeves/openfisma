     * Construct a tab view instance with a unique ID
     * 
     * Each tab view object needs an ID that is unique across the entire application. This enables us to render multiple
     * tab views per page, create cookies for each tab view, etc.
     * 
     * IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU NAME THE TAB VIEW AFTER THE CONTROLLER AND ACTION THAT IT SUPPORTS. For example, the 
     * FindingController::viewAction has a tab view called "FindingView". This ensures that your tab view won't conflict
     * with another tab view defined somewhere else in the application.
     * 
     * If your view needs multiple tab views, then you need to append a unique suffix to each tab view. E.g. 
     * "FindingView1", "FindingView2", etc.
     * 
     * When viewing a tab view on subsequent requests, a cookie is set to remember which tab was being displayed. The
     * objectId is used to reset the tabview to the first tab when you load the same tab view with a different object.
     * For example, if you view Finding #1, then click tab 2, then click refresh, the page will reload and select tab 2.
     * However, if you then switch to Finding #2, the first tab will be selected again.
     * 
     * If you are working on a tab view which does not represent an object (such as the application configuration view)
     * then pass null for the objectId (or omit it entirely).
     * 
     * @param string $tabViewId This ID must be unique application-wide, otherwise session cookies will conflict
     * @param int $objectId This is the ID of the object which is being displayed, or NULL.
