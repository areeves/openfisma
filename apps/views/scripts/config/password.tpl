&nbsp;&nbsp;The password policy only applies when the application is using local authentication, if you have configured the application to use an external authentication provider the password policies will be provided by that
provider. Example, if you have configured the application to use Microsoft Active Directory, the password complexity will be defined and managed by Active Directory and not the application.
