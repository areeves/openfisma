OpenFISMA Test Cases

Introduction
============
The OpenFISMA project has two types of tests built-in: functional tests written 
in Selenium, and unit tests written to work in PhpUnit. Both types of test are
designed to be automated and executed frequently, while also providing interactive 
feedback about the status of test results.

The unit tests are intended to test at a low level, ensuring that class
implementations provide proper output on a range of possible inputs, handling 
edge cases and outliers as specified in the design.

Functional tests operate at a higher level, ensuring that the application enables
users to perform their required functions. Using Selenium for this level of testing
enables testing at a very high level, simulating button clicks and text entry
and allowing test cases to quickly verify a very broad range of functionality.

Put another way, unit tests verify correctness at a development level, while
functional tests verify correctness at a business level. Both types of test are
equally important for creating a high-quality product.

Functional Tests
================
Selenium test cases are stored under the test/selenium directory. These test cases
are intended to be run from within a browser that supports JavaScript. To enable 
these tests, you will need to make the test directory accessibly from a web browser,
for example:

ln -s /site/root/test /site/root/public/test

You will then be able to acccess the test suite at http://yoursite.com/test. 

Unit Tests
==========
PhpUnit test cases are stored under the test/unit directory. <TODO complete 
information about unit tests.>
