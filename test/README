Q: How can I install test database?
A: Warning: This process will cover your fisma database by sql files, so backup database if it necessary.
   Step:
	1.Download database file 20080407_r210.rar from: http://140.239.107.107/publish/testdata/20080407_r210.rar
	2.Unzip the *.sql files to directory test/20080407_r210
	3.open brower url: http://servername:port/zfentry.php/test/dbrecover
and then waiting for database loading finished. 
You could follow the notes and check out your config if it shows failure.

   Then you can access your test page by url:http://servername:port/test/index.html .

Q: How to add a new test case?
A:	1. Write the new test case through Selenium IDE, see http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SIDE/Recording+a+Test .
	2. Upload it to fit sub directory in cases/ovms/ with a fit name.
	3. Update TestSuite.html, add a new line like <tr><td><a href="./cases/ovms/new_test.html">new test name</a></td></tr> before </tbody> tag.
	4. Run test with url http://servername:port/test/index.html .

Q: How to get the test result?
A: There are two ways. First, if you have a sendmail configuration in you PHP.ini, it will auto send a email to you (modify the email address in postResults.php).
   Second, if you don't have a sendmail configuration with your PHP.ini, it will just log the test result under directory 'log' as a html file, so please make sure this directory is writable. 
	
Enjoy it!
