Overview
====================
OpenFISMA utilizes Cruisecontrol with PHPUndercontrol for continuous integration.
CruiseControl is a framework for a continuous build process. It includes, but is not 
limited to, plugins for email notification, Ant, and various source control tools. 
A web interface is provided to view the details of the current and previous builds.

Instructions
====================
Projects are stored under the /projects directory of cruisecontrol. You may create
a new project by creating a new directory. In this example we will create a new
project titled projecta. 

First we will create a new project directory
mkdir /opt/cruisecontrol/projects/projecta

Then we will copy the build files to the project directory
cp /tmp/build.xml /opt/cruisecontrol/projects/projecta
cp /tmp/build.properties /opt/cruisecontrol/projects/projecta

Then we will edit the build.properties file
nano /opt/cruisecontrol/projects/projecta

Then we will need to edit the build.xml file, be sure to change the project name to projecta
nano /opt/cruisecontrol/projects/projecta

Then we will need to copy the config.xml file or edit the existing one for cruisecontrol.
cp /tmp/config.xml /opt/cruisecontrol
