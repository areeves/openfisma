/**
    backup.php

    This is a script to take a backup of an OpenFISMA application
    instance. The script makes a copy of all source code files and also
    produces a schema dump. The backup is tar'ed and gzip'ed.

    Before running this script, make sure to edit the
    backup-restore.cfg file to specify the proper database access
    properties.

    The script is designed to run in a POSIX environment, but may run
    under windows if a compatible mysqldump and tar executable exists
    in the path.
