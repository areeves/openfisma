# 
# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
# 
# Use this section to describe the application's directory structure 
# and locations, both physically on the server and from the web.
#
# APP_URL specifies the www-accessible address for the application
# APP_ROOT specifies the installation directory of the application

# application url and root directory - modify to suit needs
APP_URL  = http://127.0.0.1/ovms/trunk/www/

# 
# ENCRYPTION CONFIGURATION
#  
# This section configures the encryption cipher algorithms used by the
# application. Symmetric ciphers are implemented by PHP's interface to
# the mcrypt (preferrably >2.5.5) command and library. See the php.net
# manual page and the mcrypt home page for further information.
#
# http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net
# http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mcrypt.php
#
# All federal information systems should refer to "FIPS 140-2 Annex A: 
# Approved Security Functions for FIPS PUB 140-2, Security Requirements
# For Cryptographic Modules" for acceptable cipher algorithms
#
# http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402annexa.pdf
# 
# CIPHER_HASH specifies one-way (hashing) encryption algorithm
# - supported ciphers: SHA1, MD5, CRC32
#
# CYPHER_SYMMETRIC specifies the two-way encryption algorithm
# - supported ciphers: MCRYPT_DES, MCRYPT_3DES, MCRYPT_SKIPJACK
# - note: AES encryption is also acceptible under FIPS 140-2A but is not
#   implemented in mcrypt for PHP
#
# CIPHER_MODE specifies the block cipher mode for symmetric encryption
# - supported modes: MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, MCRYPT_MODE_CFB,
#   MCRYPT_MODE_OFB, MCRYPT_MODE_NOFB, MCRYPT_MODE_STREAM 

# hash cipher

# SESSION_TIMEOUT specifies the maximum idle time before a forced logout
# SESSION_PATH specifies the path on the server which the cookie is valid
# SESSION_DOMAIN specfies the domain over which the cookie is valid
# SESSION_EXIPRATION specifies the length of time (in seconds) until the
#   cookie expires in the browser if left open
# SESSION_SECURE_ONLY specifies that the cookie should only be set over
#    a secure connection

# 
# DB_TYPE - type of database connection (MYSQL, MYSQLI)
# DB_HOST - location (IP or URL) of database connection
# DB_PORT - port to connect to
# DB_USER - user name with which to connect
# DB_PASS - user password with which to connect
# DB_NAME - database name to use

# SMARTY CONFIGURATION
# 
# Smarty configuration is designed to allow for arbitrary versions of
# the Smarty libraries to be installed for the application.
#
# APP_LIB/Smarty is a symlink to the APP_LIB/Smarty-x.y.z/libs
# that may be updated as versions change without altering application
# configuration.
# 
# Since the templates will typically not change in the event of a
# version change with Smarty, they are kept underneath the root dir
# for the application.
#
# NOTE: If PHP is being run as an Apache module, SMARTY_COMPILE_DIR
# and SMARTY_CACHE_DIR must be writable by the Apache user and chmod
# 775.
