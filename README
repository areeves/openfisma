Overview
============================================================================
The OpenFISMA project is an open source application designed to reduce the 
complexity and automate the regulatory requirements of the Federal Information 
Security Management Act (FISMA) and the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). While many security managers 
are eager to demonstrate their best practices for incident response, patch 
management, and configuration management, they are overwhelmed with the 
reporting and documentation requirements of FISMA. You can download our 
released software right away or peruse the current documentation.

OpenFISMA is built on the Zend Framework which is an open source, object 
oriented, web application framework with a flexible architecture. ZF is 
often referred to as a 'component library' because it has many loosely 
coupled components that you can use more or less independently. However, 
Zend Framework also provides a core model-view-controller (MVC) 
implementation that you can use to provide basic 'best practices' 
structure to web applications.
