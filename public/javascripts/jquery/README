OpenFISMA uses jQuery which is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that 
simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax 
interactions for rapid web development. jQuery provides a very lightweight
footprint, is CSS3 Compliant, and provides built-in Cross-browser support.

OpenFISMA also relies on the jQuery UI which provides abstractions for 
low-level interaction and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of 
the jQuery JavaScript Library, that you can use to build highly interactive 
web applications.

jQuery UI features a wide range of core interaction plugins as well as many 
UI widgets. It's possible to use components individually. OpenFISMA 
currently uses the following UI features:

Core
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Core is a required dependency for all other plugins and contains basic 
functions and initializers.

  UI Core - The core of jQuery UI, required for all interaction modules
            and widgets

Interaction 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The core of the library revolves around different interaction modules, some 
of them required by most of the widgets.

  Draggable  - Makes any element on the page drag and droppable. 
  Droppable  - Generated drop targets for draggable elements.
  Sortable   - Makes a list of items sortable.
  Selectable - Makes a list of elements mouse selectable by dragging a box or
               clicking on them. 
  Resizable  - Makes any element on the page resizable. Optionally uses 
               themes.

Widgets 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On top of the core interaction modules are built a number of reusable widgets 
with a graphical representation and support for themes.

  Accordion    - Creates a accordion effect from existing markup, like seen
                 on apple.com 
  #Autocomplete - Autocompletes a text input with remote or local data. 
  #Colorpicker  - Colorpicker that can be attached to a input or be displayed
                 inline. 
  Dialog       - Opens existing markup in a draggable and resizable dialog. 
  Datepicker   - A datepicker that can be toggled from a input or displayed
                 inline.
  #Magnifier    - Creates a similar effect than the OSX Dock, but highly
                 configurable.
  #Progressbar  - A status indicator that can be used for a loading state and
                 standard percentage indicators.
  Slider       - A flexible slider with multiple ranges and accessibility
                 via keyboard.
  Spinner      - A spinner form component that allows to spin through values. 
  Tabs         - Transforms a set of container elements into a tab structure.

Effects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rich effects that assist certain widgets and can be used standalone 
(Without jQuery UI's core).

  Effects Core       - Extends the internal jQuery effects, includes morphing, 
                       easing and is required by all other effects.
  Effect "Blind"     - Blinds the element. 
  Effect "Bounce"    - Bounces an element horizontally or vertically n-times.
  Effect "Clip"      - Clips the element on and off like an old TV.
  Effect "Drop"      - A Drop out effect by moving the element in one direction 
                       and hiding it at the same time.
  Effect "Explode"   - The element explodes in all directions into n pieces. 
                       Also supports imploding again.
  Effect "Fold"      - Folds the element first horizontally and then vertically.
  Effect "Highlight" - Highlights the background of the element in a defined 
                       color for a custom duration.
  Effect "Pulsate"   - The element pulsates n times by changing the opacity to 
                       zero and back.
  Effect "Scale"     - Grow or shrink any element and it's content and restore 
                       it again.
  Effect "Shake"     - Shakes the element horizontally or vertically n times.
  Effect "Slide"     - The element slides in and out of the viewport.
  Effect "Transfer"  - Transfer effect from one element to another


TODO - Review functionality list and trim to used values only. Items marked
with a # are not included in the current packed version of the UI. Recommend
adding autocomplete and removing unecessary effects and widgets.
